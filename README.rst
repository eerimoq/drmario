Dr. Mario
=========

Use cases
---------

1. Single player streamed with OBS.

   In OBS, add the Dr. Mario filter to the game video capture.

2. Tournament match streamed with OBS.

   Players streams without Dr. Mario filter. The restreamer creates a
   two player tournament scene in OBS and adds the Dr. Mario filter on
   the scene (a group). Not possible with async filter unfortunately.
